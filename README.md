# su_wiki
Stands Unknown Wiki {Wiki for a ROBLOX game}

## To do list:

Stands informations, Game redirect, "How to play" archive and Login

## Plan:

-- Making the basic structure to the wiki, such as Staff/Player sign-in/sign-up 

-- Making a "Staff Online" thingy

-- Giving the staff roles such as Mods, Admins, Devs etc.. Their permissions like; "Delete Comment" "Update Stand Cards" etc.

# More will be added later.
